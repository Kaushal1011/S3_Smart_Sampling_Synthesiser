# S3_Smart_Sampling_Synthesiser

Central Repository of the S3 (Hopefully a vst soon) Smart Sampling Synthesiser

An additive synthesiser that generates wavetable from an input sample by using linear regression to find weights of harmonics. Currently being developed in Python (Pyo, PyQt5, wxpython).
In Future JUCE C++ or Rust looks a good option
